# ML_Portfolio
Class Portfolio for CS 4375 - Machine Learning

## Overview
[This](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is an overview document that discusses introductory ML concepts and a small section on personal ML interest

## C++ Data Exploration
[This](dataExploration.cpp) is the first assignment of the course, where we recreate essential statistical models found in R and create them ourselves in C++ with limited use of libraries. It is also accompanied by a [description document.](ML_Portfolio_Assignment.pdf)

## Regression and Classification
This is a project done in R on linear and logistic regressions with a splash of Naive Bayes where we find datasets on the internet and try to make models of them and perform an anaylsis. You can find them [here](Regression.pdf) and [here.](Classification.pdf)
