# ML_Portfolio
Class Portfolio for CS 4375 - Machine Learning

## Overview
[This](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is an overview document that discusses introductory ML concepts and a small section on personal ML interest

## C++ Data Exploration
[This](dataExploration.cpp) is the first assignment of the course, where we recreate essential statistical models found in R and create them ourselves in C++ with limited use of libraries. It is also accompanied by a [description document.](ML_Portfolio_Assignment.pdf)

## Regression and Classification
This is a project done in R on linear and logistic regressions with a splash of Naive Bayes where we find datasets on the internet and try to make models of them and perform an anaylsis. You can find them [here](Regression.pdf) and [here.](Classification.pdf)

## ML from Scratch
This was a group project where a classmate and I implemented logistic regression and naive bayes algorithms in C++ and ran it on a titanic test data set. You can find the files here. 
[Logistic Regression](LogR.cpp)
[Naive Bayes](naiveBayes.cpp)

## Similarity
This group project was a deep dive into clustering and dimensional reduction, along with sharpening our regression and classification skills. The section I had contributed was the dimensionality reduction, which can be found here. [Dimensionality Reduction pdf](https://github.com/Jackshouka/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf)
Addtional group member work can be found below and in the similarity folder!
